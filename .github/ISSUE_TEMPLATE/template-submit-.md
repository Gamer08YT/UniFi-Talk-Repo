## Template Options:

**Provider:** Example Provider
**Template:** example.json 
**Region:** for example, Germany

## Test Options:
**Console Name:** 

### How the process works:
1. You invite “unifitalk@ui.com” as an admin for UniFi Talk on your console.
2. You tell me the Name of your console (don't worry, I can't do anything with it, it's just for clarity for the UI developers).
3. Ubiquiti will contact you either by email or on the official UI forum, whichever you prefer.
4. In the penultimate step, UI may install a custom Talk version that only you and the developers have.
5. Finally, UI will make a few calls (to toll-free numbers, of course; you can also specify preferred numbers) to verify that the template actually works before it is released.

**I accept no liability for damage or loss, as I am merely referring you to UI. I always recommend making a backup.**
