**For local rendering/preview you Template please enable GitHub Pages on your forked Repo, otherwise the preview will not work.**

#### Implementation in UniFi Talk

When you like, I can redirect the template to the official UniFi Talk Developer Team, wich will publish it.

Keep in mind that for this process we need your consent to test it on your side, if you don't want a test on your own console, there is a chance that Ubiquiti will send you a Console for testing.


### As with all of my repositories, I would like to point out that I am in no way affiliated with Ubiquiti or UniFi.
#### In this case, I will simply forward your templates and contact details to the correct address at Ubiquiti.
