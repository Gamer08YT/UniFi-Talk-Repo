**For local rendering/preview you Template please enable GitHub Pages on your forked Repo, otherwise the preview will not work.**

**_Please provide only working SIP Templates._**

#### Implementation in UniFi Talk

When you like, I can redirect the template to the official UniFi Talk Developer Team, wich will publish it.

Keep in mind that for this process we need your consent, to test it on your side, if you don't want a test on you own console, there is a chance that Ubiquiti will send you an Console for testing.
